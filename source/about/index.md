## About the Open Culture Foundation

Open Culture Foundation (OCF) is dedicated to supporting local communities to use open technologies in a broad variety of sectors. OCF helps governments, enterprises, and NGOs recognize the advantages of Open Source Software, the importance of Open Data, and promotes the culture of open collaboration. In 2015, OCF supported local communities in implementing several large-scale hackathons and conferences, and worked with foreign missions and agencies such as the British Office Taipei, the American Institute in Taiwan, and The World Bank Group, to bridge the gap between local and international communities through discussions.
